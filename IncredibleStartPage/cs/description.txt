Permissions
- Incredible StartPage does not access your Facebook or Flickr accounts. It only downloads wallpapers from these photo-sharing sites.
- Chrome does not allow extensions to load local files as wallpapers.

Known issues
- If you use ad-blockers such as AdBlock and AdThwart, you may need to disable them in the StartPage (add "newtab" and "ncdfeghkpohnalmpblddmnppfooljekh" to the whitelist)
- If you get "Chrome Bookmarks are not ready", it means Chrome is still starting up, just wait a few seconds and reload Incredible StartPage
- Extensions cannot read the most visited sites information at the moment
- Bookmarklets do not work inside the StartPage

Disclaimer
- Due to Chrome limitations, extensions cannot restore history from closed tabs. If you need the history from a recently closed tab, press Ctrl+Shift+T to reopen them one by one.
- To get back Chrome's original start page, just go to "Extension" from the "Wrench" menu, and disable/uninstall the extension.
