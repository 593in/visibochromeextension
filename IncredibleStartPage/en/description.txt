Disclaimer
- Due to Chrome limitations, extensions cannot restore history from closed tabs. If you need the history from a recently closed tab, you can press Ctrl+Shift+T to reopen them one by one.
- FYI: To get back Chrome's original start page, just go to "Extension" from the "Wrench" menu, and disable/uninstall the extension.
