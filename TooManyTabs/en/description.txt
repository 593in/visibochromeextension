Ever tried having 20 tabs or more open in Chrome? You canâ€™t even see the favicon of the tabs, not to mention the tab titles! If that happens to you, TooManyTabs is a must-have extension that manages your tabs, reduces your tab overflow, and saves your sanity!

From the makers of TooManyTabs for Firefox, TMT has come to Chrome to help all your tab needs!
